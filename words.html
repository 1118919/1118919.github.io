i used to work in greenpoint for a photographer who promised me a raise after three months and then refused to give me a raise after three months so i quit in a really passive aggressive email and she called me and left a long voicemail saying we could "work something out" at "$16/hr" and i never called her back so she sent me my last check and then i never talked to her again and then i was googling her two years later to see what she was up to and i read an article in vanityfair about how she died and i felt so bad so weird so regretful for not apologizing, for my hard-headed behavior at age 23, so i bought a $70 vase shaped like a fish and stuck a bunch of dried lavender in it and i felt a little better but not by much, because obviously things can't fill the weird holes that regret pokes in your heart and how it eats at you from the inside. 
<br><br>
today we were on set in the studio next door to her old studio but what i didn't realize until maybe an hour in was that the studio we were in used to actually be her studio - the studio next door must have taken over the entire floor and renovated it completely to where i couldn't really recognize it until i went up and down the stairs a few times and remembered that yeah, she used to be on the third floor, and yeah, that used to be her view of the water out the window that faced north. the photographer used to make me walk her shitty little chihuahua every time i went in and i hated that dog so much and i've never hated a dog like that before. i wonder where her boyfriend is and if he's okay. i wouldn't be working in production if she hadn't hired me back when i first moved to new york and isn't that weird? that i am where i am because a white woman took a chance on me three years ago and i guess a couple more took more chances on me and now another one is taking a chance on me and hiring me consistently to the point where i have disposable income and can spend it on stuff like a six week japanese ceramics course? 
<br><br>
i've been looking further into my birth chart and i think it's very funny because a lot of it is luck - multiple signs say i cannot handle money in any way that makes sense but it's ok because usually something works out. which is true, i think. every job i've had i've fallen into and people take chances on me even if i don't really understand why they're doing so. i'm not undermining or underestimating myself - i just know that most jobs people have, most other people can do. none of us are really all that different and sometimes i feel like a fast-learning monkey. but at least now i'm getting paid a bit more for it.

i woke up today and had to put on clothes because there was a cool breeze coming through the kitchen window. things are changing because things are ending.
<br><br>
last summer i also went west - i visited my mom and we took a weekend trip to the coast where we went clamming at 6am (low tide). we were unprepared, both wearing flip flops when the water was almost too cold, almost unbearable, and i kept digging up dead clams before realizing maybe after the fifth one that i was digging straight into their shells, probably killing them with my shovel. we started using our bare hands and after a while both of us had a bunch of cuts on both hands because we kept scraping our fingers on sharp rocks. i eventually gave up and started walking around as the tide came in. clams - geoducks, which is what we were after - are funny, because they stay about 1-2 feet underground but their necks extend all the way to the surface to breathe, so everywhere i looked there were little squirts of water, clams breathing, clams letting me know they were there. i talked to a dad and his son, who had been coming to the coast for a decade every summer, who kindly gave me three of their clams after i said my mom and i weren't having any luck. i thought the clams were too cute to eat, which i told my mom, but she was determined to cook and eat them. what she didn't realize was how they look like penises after you extract them from their shell, and she was horrified when we went home and cleaned them. she left them - these flesh colored penises - in a tupperware bin in the fridge for a week before they shriveled up and she finally threw them away.
<br><br>
i stayed with jeannie for a week in sf and lost my mind thinking about how beautiful california was. i briefly entertained the idea of moving to sf before realizing how everyone i met that week was confused by me for firmly declaring i hated working, have always hated working, would never want to work. i saw peter for the last time that week. he cooked the meat at kbbq and he seemed down, which i didn't think was possible for him. he let me choose what music to listen to in his new car - some fancy audi he finally saved enough money for - and i put on carly rae jepsen's new album while he told me about his misadventures in love. he was always dating pretty girls who wanted to control him completely. he just wanted to party in vegas. he told me he'd visit new york in a few months but he never made it. 
<br><br>
i read that joan didion book about grief because my sister recommended it and didion is right when she says it comes in waves. these days i'm mostly fine because i'm like a little rabbit with my little rabbit brain running around the city checking off the tasks assigned to me for work but sometimes i think about how senseless everything really is, how cruel. sometimes i'll be crying on the train and it doesn't really make any sense because at this point crying does nothing for me. i've tried to explain to people the hole i found myself in for a month when i came back to new york in mid july but it's hard to really convey how terrified i was of everything. i thought i had to leave the city entirely to feel like a person again but i couldn't even really think about where to go. that month, i spent at least 30 minutes every day crying about how maggie took care of me and how i only really started eating again because she made me. i crawled out of the hole eventually but i can still feel it there, next to me, like i might fall in again.

on the b38 today:
<br>
my friend in the east village has a bathtub in the ground so she has to step down into it to take a shower it is extremely cool and i think maybe makes a lot of sense 
<br><br>

transporting two bags of frozen ikea meatballs across brooklyn - i hope this is worth it because they are heavy 
<br><br>

i have nothing against asian-white couples i just think it’s funny they always seem to be riding revels
<br><br>

when my hair gets long enough to touch my ass maybe i’ll put it into two braids and move to the desert to go stare at rocks (probably age 32) 
</p>

things i've found beautiful lately:
<br>
mustard dish towels, waffle texture

the color #97B998
<br>
someone who smelled like soap
<br>
sunset gradient i witnessed after a 12 hour shoot, a diagonal bright pink fading into a royal blue
<br>
all the bts boys except for jin
<br>
every asian girl i've ever seen
<br>
cotton candy pink velour
<br>
a brown-gold bundle of thick yarn
<br>
that ikea bag bucket hat
<br><br>
i'm getting used to the slope of my apartment though i still resent my roommate for pointing it out in the first place. once i became aware of it i felt like i was sliding, lost any sense of balance i thought i had. i am happy to be living with a friend - i am happy i took the steps to make sure i'd survive the coming winter. i haven't talked to a few people in a while, i don't think i have it in me to keep in touch with people who resent me a little bit. it's funny to realize that the concept of "frenemies" still exists at age 25.

things i left behind and still want: edibles, ten avocado skins (for dyeing), superbad magnet, clothes hangers, mannequin legs
<br>
i lost three plant cuttings during the move, they couldn't adjust to the new light and shriveled up and died 
<br>
i completely lost my ability to sleep through the night. maybe developed a tolerance for 10mg melatonin, looking for more effective "non addictive" sleeping pills
<br>

i once watched my grandmother use the blunt end of her chopstick to remove floating tea leaves that were in her cup after the first pour at dim sum. i didn’t know you were allowed to do that—my parents ignored them and drank them and swallowed them, acting like they weren’t there. the other week, someone watched me use a spoon to slowly remove the coarse coffee grounds that were floating in my cup. he thought it was excessive, and drank and swallowed his. we talked a lot but i’m pretty sure neither of us paid much attention to what we were saying. sometimes there exists a distance that can’t be bridged between two people but sometimes it doesn’t matter if both those people think the other is beautiful. i’ve found it easier to not give things too much thought—if you look too closely everything becomes very sad.

i'm sitting by a river that i didn't mean to find. i got here by going left every time i came across a fork in the path and now i’m very far away from wherever i parked my car. i thought about asking the other people on the trail where we were but what would i do with that information? it would mean nothing to me.

<br><br>

tall trees filter out sunlight in a way that makes it seem like i'm experiencing unreality, like the lighting is slightly off, like everything is rendered slightly wrong, like someone fucked up trying to trick me into believing this is really my life. 

<br><br>

there is a meditation practice about a river which goes like this: you close your eyes and visualize a river. use all five senses to fully imagine the scene; think about how it looks, sounds, smells, how the air feels and tastes. then you visualize leaves on the river surface  and start to notice your thoughts. put each thought on a separate leaf and send it downstream. you watch them float away, no judgements for what they are. when i first did this on the phone with my therapist, my leaves were small: how my coffee got cold and the almond milk separated in a disgusting way, the sound of the ambulances outside, how i was sitting uncomfortably on the floor. then i started visualizing physically larger leaves for my larger thoughts, like how it sometimes feels like i’m being crushed by history, or how hopeless it feels to bear witness to mass death.
<br><br>

everything still feels unreal but i find my car eventually.
