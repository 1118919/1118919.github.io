i once watched my grandmother use the blunt end of her chopstick to remove floating tea leaves that were in her cup after the first pour at dim sum. i didn’t know you were allowed to do that—my parents ignored them and drank them and swallowed them, acting like they weren’t there. the other week, someone watched me use a spoon to slowly remove the coarse coffee grounds that were floating in my cup. he thought it was excessive, and drank and swallowed his. we talked a lot but i’m pretty sure neither of us paid much attention to what we were saying. sometimes there exists a distance that can’t be bridged between two people but sometimes it doesn’t matter if both those people think the other is beautiful. i’ve found it easier to not give things too much thought—if you look too closely everything becomes very sad.

i'm sitting by a river that i didn't mean to find. i got here by going left every time i came across a fork in the path and now i’m very far away from wherever i parked my car. i thought about asking the other people on the trail where we were but what would i do with that information? it would mean nothing to me.

<br><br>

tall trees filter out sunlight in a way that makes it seem like i'm experiencing unreality, like the lighting is slightly off, like everything is rendered slightly wrong, like someone fucked up trying to trick me into believing this is really my life. 

<br><br>

there is a meditation practice about a river which goes like this: you close your eyes and visualize a river. use all five senses to fully imagine the scene; think about how it looks, sounds, smells, how the air feels and tastes. then you visualize leaves on the river surface  and start to notice your thoughts. put each thought on a separate leaf and send it downstream. you watch them float away, no judgements for what they are. when i first did this on the phone with my therapist, my leaves were small: how my coffee got cold and the almond milk separated in a disgusting way, the sound of the ambulances outside, how i was sitting uncomfortably on the floor. then i started visualizing physically larger leaves for my larger thoughts, like how it sometimes feels like i’m being crushed by history, or how bad it feels to know that i have a body and that people sometimes look at it. 

<br><br>

everything still feels unreal but i find my car eventually.
