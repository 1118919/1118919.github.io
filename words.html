i am fucking seething i am so angry i am so annoyed after two weeks of working with three other stylists and realizing the job never needed to be as hard as it has been for the past month and a half with the main stylist i work for and it's just her underbidding for jobs and giving that work off to her assistant (me) to deal with so i'm running around the city lugging literal marble props taking multiple trains taking multiple cars destroying my body in the process begging businesses to do things last minute even without an appropriate budget all the while having her tell me it's a $300/day job and i'll never get paid overtime but the long long list of things she needs me to do stretches easily into 10-12 hours which doesn't include the amount of time i spend thinking about it. i knew i was doing the work of two assistants. i didn't realize until yesterday that i've been doing the work of two assistants on a time crunch that other stylists wouldn't agree to. i knew the main stylist is a bit of a mean girl. i didn't know until yesterday the extent of that - when her previous first assist told me how she had been treated for two years. 
<br><br>
no one except her previous first assist knows what i'm talking about. i thought i was good at spotting abusive workplaces but this all happened so fast i'm reeling from the realization that i've found myself in another abusive workplace and i am looking for a way out immediately.

o! what a life! convincing the person who hired me that 3pm is too late to buy anything else! leaving by 4! getting home and organizing my clothing in a way that makes sense! drinking a cup of scalding hot water and finishing the mochi i bought a week ago that got a little hard in the fridge! opening a small package from my mom that contained a wing wah mooncake and a small bottle of argan oil! putting on a black hoodie and not sweating!
<br><br>
i overpaid for soy sauce at hmart the other day and maybe that was the worst thing to happen to me in the past week. three days ago, i spent 2 hours fighting clay before a ceramicist i admire (and find really attractive) told me that all the wheels go at different speeds and i was going way too fast on mine. fixed my cone. started building a cup. tried to pull out to form a base but had trouble, pulled out a small piece of leather in the clay. felt better for finding the source of my troubles. rebuilt my cone. started building a cup again. finished cup. three hours had passed and the studio was closing. my friend next to me had built something like 5-6 cups during the time i was sweating and upset at my clay. packed up and bought myself korean fried chicken and carried it all the way home. thought i was going to save half of it but could not stop myself from finishing it - haven't enjoyed food to that extent in a while, haven't overate like that in a while. 
<br><br>
dad texts me on signal and when i'm not mad at him i'm mad at some other chinese malaysian man who texts me on signal and has the biggest ego i've ever encountered. thought maybe we could spend more time together but after three times it became obviously clear to me that i made a mistake. trying to disappear ... reminding myself to stop placing beauty on a pedestal ...

<br>a small egg shaped rock that is heavier than it looks, which i got from a rocky beach in washington state, it is the best thing i own and would legitimately wreck me if i were to lose/break it 
<br>a toddler's hand made out of clay that luke gave me which he found at a garage sale in nj
<br>pisces candle gifted to me from friend who makes beautiful things all the time
<br>dresser joe gave me because it didn't make sense for him to have it, as he virtually has one/two outfits total

last december in malaysia my dad booked us a 6 hour cave trek where 
<br>we swam in an underground river 
<br>slid on giant slabs of marble 
<br>saw baby bats and the biggest spider i've ever seen
<br>squeezed our bodies into small crevices in complete darkness
<br>and i thought it was maybe one of the nicer things he's done for me. 
<br><br>
i asked him what my name in chinese meant and he said it's something along the lines of "girl who will be okay anywhere she is" but that he wishes he named me something more like "girl who does whatever she wants." if i was actually the version of me that my dad sees me as, i would feel better, i think. i don't think he realizes how afraid i am of so many things, how i feel beaten up and not very strong at all. i'm not okay with most things because i notice everything and all of it bothers me. i guess i'm okay wherever i am because i'm forced to be, but it's not really a choice i'm making.

every day is harder than the last but somehow i'm better able to deal with it. 
<br><br>
i don't want to explain my job to anyone because i find it boring. i bore myself trying to talk about how my day was or why it feels like i was hit by a car for like an hour immediately after i wake up. i think maybe also my knee bones are starting to rub together or something, there's a lot of pain there too. obviously i'm not getting paid enough if it's destroying my body but sometimes it pays really well and i don't do anything, maybe visit a store and buy one thing or return one thing. it's supposed to all even out but the past week has been so hard i booked a week-long escape from the city with jack, who i haven't seen in person since january i think. i mostly want to drive for a while and then maybe find a mountain to climb and a tree to stare at.

this is an excerpt from the zine i wrote in arizona. i still need to edit the words and pick out the photos and figure out how i want to print and bind it but that won't take too long, i have an idea. this is my favorite memory of him, the summer after freshman year of college when all my friends and i went back to colorado. 
<br><br>

if we can believe that time is a human construct, that the past and the future have their own coordinates in a four dimensional structure of spacetime that exists outside our understanding of the present, then maybe our experiences aren’t linear and everything that will happen has already happened and everything that already happened is just looping again and again and again. then maybe that means we are always there, floating in a small inflatable raft held up by a vast expanse of gentle water, smoother than silk. maybe the sun is always shining on us, golden and warm and kind, and maybe you’re always using one oar to spin us in a slow circle. maybe the valley we’re in feels like we’re being held by something larger, stronger, and maybe the pine trees rustled by the wind look like they’re laughing, because we’re always laughing, and laughter is really everywhere. 
<br><br>
we are mirrored by everything that is alive.

it's actually good to be aware that you can't do anything alone, that you have needs and that once you recognize them, that you're allowed to ask for help in meeting those needs. everything i've done i've done because of someone else. every part of me exists because i am changed by every interaction i've had. we are changing all the time ... isn't that beautiful? i no longer recognize myself and i don't recognize you either but i love that i still like you and you still like me enough that we can change in different ways but maybe in the same general direction.

i used to work in greenpoint for a photographer who promised me a raise after three months and then refused to give me a raise after three months so i quit in a really passive aggressive email and she called me and left a long voicemail saying we could "work something out" at "$16/hr" and i never called her back so she sent me my last check and then i never talked to her again and then i was googling her two years later to see what she was up to and i read an article in vanityfair about how she died and i felt so bad so weird so regretful for not apologizing, for my hard-headed behavior at age 23, so i bought a $70 vase shaped like a fish and stuck a bunch of dried lavender in it and i felt a little better but not by much, because obviously things can't fill the weird holes that regret pokes in your heart and how it eats at you from the inside. 
<br><br>
today we were on set in the studio next door to her old studio but what i didn't realize until maybe an hour in was that the studio we were in used to actually be her studio - the studio next door must have taken over the entire floor and renovated it completely to where i couldn't really recognize it until i went up and down the stairs a few times and remembered that yeah, she used to be on the third floor, and yeah, that used to be her view of the water out the window that faced north. the photographer used to make me walk her shitty little chihuahua every time i went in and i hated that dog so much and i've never hated a dog like that before. i wonder where her boyfriend is and if he's okay. i wouldn't be working in production if she hadn't hired me back when i first moved to new york and isn't that weird? that i am where i am because a white woman took a chance on me three years ago and i guess a couple more took more chances on me and now another one is taking a chance on me and hiring me consistently to the point where i have disposable income and can spend it on stuff like a six week japanese ceramics course? 
<br><br>
i've been looking further into my birth chart and i think it's very funny because a lot of it is luck - multiple signs say i cannot handle money in any way that makes sense but it's ok because usually something works out. which is true, i think. every job i've had i've fallen into and people take chances on me even if i don't really understand why they're doing so. i'm not undermining or underestimating myself - i just know that most jobs people have, most other people can do. none of us are really all that different and sometimes i feel like a fast-learning monkey. but at least now i'm getting paid a bit more for it.

i woke up today and had to put on clothes because there was a cool breeze coming through the kitchen window. things are changing because things are ending.
<br><br>
last summer i also went west - i visited my mom and we took a weekend trip to the coast where we went clamming at 6am (low tide). we were unprepared, both wearing flip flops when the water was almost too cold, almost unbearable, and i kept digging up dead clams before realizing maybe after the fifth one that i was digging straight into their shells, probably killing them with my shovel. we started using our bare hands and after a while both of us had a bunch of cuts on both hands because we kept scraping our fingers on sharp rocks. i eventually gave up and started walking around as the tide came in. clams - geoducks, which is what we were after - are funny, because they stay about 1-2 feet underground but their necks extend all the way to the surface to breathe, so everywhere i looked there were little squirts of water, clams breathing, clams letting me know they were there. i talked to a dad and his son, who had been coming to the coast for a decade every summer, who kindly gave me three of their clams after i said my mom and i weren't having any luck. i thought the clams were too cute to eat, which i told my mom, but she was determined to cook and eat them. what she didn't realize was how they look like penises after you extract them from their shell, and she was horrified when we went home and cleaned them. she left them - these flesh colored penises - in a tupperware bin in the fridge for a week before they shriveled up and she finally threw them away.
<br><br>
i stayed with jeannie for a week in sf and lost my mind thinking about how beautiful california was. i briefly entertained the idea of moving to sf before realizing how everyone i met that week was confused by me for firmly declaring i hated working, have always hated working, would never want to work. i saw peter for the last time that week. he cooked the meat at kbbq and he seemed down, which i didn't think was possible for him. he let me choose what music to listen to in his new car - some fancy audi he finally saved enough money for - and i put on carly rae jepsen's new album while he told me about his misadventures in love. he was always dating pretty girls who wanted to control him completely. he just wanted to party in vegas. he told me he'd visit new york in a few months but he never made it. 
<br><br>
i read that joan didion book about grief because my sister recommended it and didion is right when she says it comes in waves. these days i'm mostly fine because i'm like a little rabbit with my little rabbit brain running around the city checking off the tasks assigned to me for work but sometimes i think about how senseless everything really is, how cruel. sometimes i'll be crying on the train and it doesn't really make any sense because at this point crying does nothing for me. i've tried to explain to people the hole i found myself in for a month when i came back to new york in mid july but it's hard to really convey how terrified i was of everything. i thought i had to leave the city entirely to feel like a person again but i couldn't even really think about where to go. that month, i spent at least 30 minutes every day crying about how maggie took care of me and how i only really started eating again because she made me. i crawled out of the hole eventually but i can still feel it there, next to me, like i might fall in again.

i'm getting used to the slope of my apartment though i still resent my roommate for pointing it out in the first place. once i became aware of it i felt like i was sliding, lost any sense of balance i thought i had. i am happy to be living with a friend - i am happy i took the steps to make sure i'd survive the coming winter. i haven't talked to a few people in a while, i don't think i have it in me to keep in touch with people who resent me a little bit. it's funny to realize that the concept of "frenemies" still exists at age 25.

i once watched my grandmother use the blunt end of her chopstick to remove floating tea leaves that were in her cup after the first pour at dim sum. i didn’t know you were allowed to do that—my parents ignored them and drank them and swallowed them, acting like they weren’t there. the other week, someone watched me use a spoon to slowly remove the coarse coffee grounds that were floating in my cup. he thought it was excessive, and drank and swallowed his. we talked a lot but i’m pretty sure neither of us paid much attention to what we were saying. sometimes there exists a distance that can’t be bridged between two people but sometimes it doesn’t matter if both those people think the other is beautiful. i’ve found it easier to not give things too much thought—if you look too closely everything becomes very sad.

i'm sitting by a river that i didn't mean to find. i got here by going left every time i came across a fork in the path and now i’m very far away from wherever i parked my car. i thought about asking the other people on the trail where we were but what would i do with that information? it would mean nothing to me.

<br><br>

tall trees filter out sunlight in a way that makes it seem like i'm experiencing unreality, like the lighting is slightly off, like everything is rendered slightly wrong, like someone fucked up trying to trick me into believing this is really my life. 

<br><br>

there is a meditation practice about a river which goes like this: you close your eyes and visualize a river. use all five senses to fully imagine the scene; think about how it looks, sounds, smells, how the air feels and tastes. then you visualize leaves on the river surface  and start to notice your thoughts. put each thought on a separate leaf and send it downstream. you watch them float away, no judgements for what they are. when i first did this on the phone with my therapist, my leaves were small: how my coffee got cold and the almond milk separated in a disgusting way, the sound of the ambulances outside, how i was sitting uncomfortably on the floor. then i started visualizing physically larger leaves for my larger thoughts, like how it sometimes feels like i’m being crushed by history, or how hopeless it feels to bear witness to mass death.
<br><br>

everything still feels unreal but i find my car eventually.
