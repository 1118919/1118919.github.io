<p>

things i've found beautiful lately:
<br>
mustard dish towels, waffle texture
<br>
the color #97B998
<br>
someone who smelled like soap
<br>
sunset gradient i witnessed after a 12 hour shoot, a diagonal bright pink fading into a royal blue
<br>
all the bts boys except for jin
<br>
every asian girl i've ever seen
<br>
cotton candy pink velour
<br>
a brown-gold bundle of thick yarn
<br>
that ikea bag bucket hat
<br><br>
i'm getting used to the slope of my apartment though i still resent my roommate for pointing it out in the first place. once i became aware of it i felt like i was sliding, lost any sense of balance i thought i had. i am happy to be living with a friend - i am happy i took the steps to make sure i'd survive the coming winter. i haven't talked to a few people in a while, i don't think i have it in me to keep in touch with people who resent me a little bit. it's funny to realize that the concept of "frenemies" still exists at age 25.

things i left behind and still want: edibles, ten avocado skins (for dyeing), superbad magnet, clothes hangers, mannequin legs
<br>
i lost three plant cuttings during the move, they couldn't adjust to the new light and shriveled up and died 
<br>
i completely lost my ability to sleep through the night. maybe developed a tolerance for 10mg melatonin, looking for more effective "non addictive" sleeping pills
<br>
bought two large moss green pillows and feel strongly about them (they're good)

i once watched my grandmother use the blunt end of her chopstick to remove floating tea leaves that were in her cup after the first pour at dim sum. i didn’t know you were allowed to do that—my parents ignored them and drank them and swallowed them, acting like they weren’t there. the other week, someone watched me use a spoon to slowly remove the coarse coffee grounds that were floating in my cup. he thought it was excessive, and drank and swallowed his. we talked a lot but i’m pretty sure neither of us paid much attention to what we were saying. sometimes there exists a distance that can’t be bridged between two people but sometimes it doesn’t matter if both those people think the other is beautiful. i’ve found it easier to not give things too much thought—if you look too closely everything becomes very sad.

i'm sitting by a river that i didn't mean to find. i got here by going left every time i came across a fork in the path and now i’m very far away from wherever i parked my car. i thought about asking the other people on the trail where we were but what would i do with that information? it would mean nothing to me.

<br><br>

tall trees filter out sunlight in a way that makes it seem like i'm experiencing unreality, like the lighting is slightly off, like everything is rendered slightly wrong, like someone fucked up trying to trick me into believing this is really my life. 

<br><br>

there is a meditation practice about a river which goes like this: you close your eyes and visualize a river. use all five senses to fully imagine the scene; think about how it looks, sounds, smells, how the air feels and tastes. then you visualize leaves on the river surface  and start to notice your thoughts. put each thought on a separate leaf and send it downstream. you watch them float away, no judgements for what they are. when i first did this on the phone with my therapist, my leaves were small: how my coffee got cold and the almond milk separated in a disgusting way, the sound of the ambulances outside, how i was sitting uncomfortably on the floor. then i started visualizing physically larger leaves for my larger thoughts, like how it sometimes feels like i’m being crushed by history, or how hopeless it feels to bear witness to mass death.
<br><br>

everything still feels unreal but i find my car eventually.
